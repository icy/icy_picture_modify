Hello,

This is not a good news for the users of my plugins.
In short, I don't have much time to work on this plugin,
so I decide to give it up, and I am looking for someone to help.

I still work to have bug fixes and security fixes for the latest version
2.4.6 of the plugin, but I will not give any new feature. If you're an
user of my plugin, please take a look at an alternative (if any),
and accept my apologies.

If you're a developer and you're interested in my plugin, please help
to maintain it. I can share all my knowledge. The source code of the
plugin is at https://github.com/icy/icy_picture_modify (this is the
official repository; there is an out-of-date sub-tree in Piwigo
SVN repository; pls don't use it.)

I'm very sorry for my leaving. I'd like to thank you all for your
using and supporting my plugin during the last years.

Regards,
